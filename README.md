### 🔦 Spotlight
I enjoy building things that make a real impact — from robust internal platforms to developer-friendly tools.  
Here are a few areas I’ve been focusing on recently:

- 🧱 **Component-driven front-ends** — React & Next.js, designed for reusability and clarity  
- ⚙️ **Service-first back-ends** — Node.js APIs following clean architecture patterns  
- ☁️ **Cloud automation** — GCP-based CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure scripting  
- 🧩 **Developer tooling** — internal libraries, design systems, and code quality pipelines  

Each project is a new opportunity to simplify, automate, and push the boundaries of what great software can be.

### 🌿 Beyond the Code
Outside of work, I recharge through movement, creativity, and time spent outdoors.  
I love exploring **forest trails on my MTB**, playing **tennis**, and training at the **gym** to stay sharp.  
Music is my constant companion — especially **electronic and live performances** that spark energy and focus.  
Whenever I can, I set out on **adventures to warm, distant places**, discovering new cultures and perspectives.  
Above all, I enjoy **active time with my kids** and long, peaceful **walks with my dog**, which always remind me to slow down and enjoy the moment.
