### üî¶ Spotlight  
I take pride in delivering software that lasts ‚Äî both in reliability and in value.  
Over the past few years, I‚Äôve focused on:  
- Designing and developing **React-based front-end applications** used in enterprise environments  
- Maintaining and improving existing systems for **stability, scalability, and developer efficiency**  
- Introducing **testing practices** and refining codebases for long-term maintainability  
- Supporting and mentoring less experienced developers, helping teams grow their technical confidence  

Each project has strengthened my belief that solid engineering is less about the newest framework ‚Äî and more about clear structure, ownership, and small, consistent improvements.

### üåø Beyond the Code  
When I‚Äôm not writing code, I‚Äôm usually chasing that same balance of focus and flow in other ways.  
I love **riding my MTB through quiet forest trails**, where every turn clears the mind and resets perspective.  
**Tennis and gym sessions** keep me grounded, reminding me that steady effort beats intensity.  
I‚Äôm deeply into **music ‚Äî especially electronic and live performances ‚Äî** which for me is another form of rhythm and structure, not so different from coding.  
Whenever I get the chance, I travel ‚Äî often to **warm, distant places**, drawn by curiosity for new cultures and landscapes.  
And above all, I value **time with my kids**, filled with movement, laughter, and discovery ‚Äî plus long, peaceful **walks with my dog**, the best reminder that simplicity can be its own reward.

> I believe good software should feel invisible ‚Äî fast, reliable, and effortless to use.  
> It‚Äôs the kind of engineering that disappears behind experience ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what I aim to build every day.
