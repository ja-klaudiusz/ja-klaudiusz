# 👋 Hey, I'm Klaudiusz

### 🧠 Code. Learn. Create.

I’m a full-stack engineer who loves turning ideas into things that actually *work*.  
Most of my days are spent crafting web applications with **React**, **Node.js**, and **GCP**, exploring how small architectural choices can make big differences in performance and scalability.  

I don’t chase hype — I chase *clarity*.  
Clean code, thoughtful patterns, and a strong cup of coffee are my daily essentials.

### ⚡ What I’m into right now  
- Building modern front-end systems with **React + Next.js**  
- Creating stable back-ends in **Node.js**  
- Experimenting with **cloud automation** on GCP  
- Writing tests that actually test things  
- Exploring how design and performance shape user experience

### 🌍 Outside the Editor  
When I’m not writing code, I’m probably:  
🚴‍♂️ riding my **MTB through forest trails**  
🎾 playing **tennis** or hitting the **gym**  
🎧 vibing to **electronic music** at a concert  
✈️ wandering **somewhere warm and far away**  
👨‍👧‍👦 spending **active time with my kids**  
🐶 or walking with my dog, plotting the next great idea
